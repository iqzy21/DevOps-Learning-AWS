## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Users and Groups 

#### Root Account
- Created by default when the AWS account is set up
- Shouldn't be used for everyday tasks
- Keep credentials secure; never share

#### Users
- Represent people or services in your organization
- Can be grouped for easier permission management
- Each has their own login & permissions

#### Groups
- Contain only users (no nested groups)
- Assign permissions to the group → applies to all users in it
- A user:
  - Doesn't have to belong to a group
  - Can belong to multiple groups

#### Example (From Diagram)
- **Developers Group**: Michael, Jennifer, Joey
- **Audit Team Group**: Zid
- **Operations Group**: Zid, Ferns
- **No Group**: Kasoon

## IAM: Permissions

### 1. What Are Permissions?
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- Policies = rulebooks that define what actions are allowed or denied
- Actions apply to specific AWS services/resources

### 2. Example from Diagram
**Allowed actions:**
- Describe EC2 instances
- Describe Elastic Load Balancing
- List/Get/Describe CloudWatch metrics

### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
- Only give the permissions needed to perform required tasks
- Don't allow extra actions "just in case"
- **Analogy**: Give someone the key to the backseat, not the car ignition

### 4. Why It Matters
- Keeps AWS environment secure
- Prevents mistakes or misuse
- Scales well as your organization grows

## IAM Policies – Inheritance

### 1. Group Permissions
- Users inherit all permissions assigned to the group(s) they belong to
- **Example:**
  - Developers group → Alice, Bob, Charles
  - Permissions: e.g., EC2 access, S3 access
  - Everyone in that group gets the same permissions

### 2. Multiple Groups
- A user can belong to more than one group
- They inherit permissions from all groups they are in
- **Example:**
  - Charles → Developers + DevOps Team → gets combined permissions
  - David → Operations + DevOps Team → gets combined permissions

### 3. Inline Policies
- Attached directly to a specific user
- Not shared with any group
- **Example:**
  - Fred → in Operations group + has an inline policy for extra unique permissions

### 4. Key Takeaways
- Multiple group memberships = combined permissions
- Inline policies = user-specific extra access
- **Best practice:**
  - Use groups to manage most permissions
  - Use inline policies only for special cases

## IAM: Policies Structure

### 1. Main Components
- **Version** (required) – Policy language version
  - Always use: `"2012-10-17"`
- **Id** (optional) – Identifier for the policy (e.g., name or reference)
- **Statement** (required) – One or more blocks defining the actual permissions

### 2. Statement Components
- **Sid** (optional) – Label or identifier for the statement
- **Effect** (required) – `"Allow"` or `"Deny"`
- **Principal** – Who the policy applies to (user, role, or account)
- **Action** – List of actions the policy allows or denies
- **Resource** – List of resources the actions apply to
- **Condition** (optional) – Rules for when the policy is in effect (e.g., specific IP)

### 3. Example From Diagram
- **Version**: `"2012-10-17"`
- **Id**: `"S3-Account-Permissions"`
- **Principal**: AWS root account (`arn:aws:iam::1234:root`)
- **Action**: `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`
- **Resource**: `arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*`

### 4. Key Takeaways
- A policy defines: **Who** → Can do **what** → On **which resources** → Under **what conditions**
- AWS provides pre-built policies, but understanding the structure helps with custom setups

## Password Policy

You can enforce:
- A minimum password length at least 8-12 characters
- Specific requirements: caps, no caps, numbers and special characters
- Allow IAM users to change their password
- Require users to change password after some time
- Require users to not reuse same password

![Password Policy Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d587820-8b8d-43e5-b518-cb128129a3f4)

---

## MFA - Multi Factor Authentication

This is important because your AWS account contains important resources.

**MFA benefit**: If account password is compromised, account can't be accessed unless it has an external login. This can be done by a code, third party app or verification email.

![MFA Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1bca3a-0d93-4d37-b17f-9da33de9e69b)

### MFA Options in AWS

#### Virtual MFA Device
- Virtual authenticator app e.g., Google Authenticator
- They send a one time code to access on the app on your smart phone

#### Universal 2nd Factor Security Key
- e.g., YubiKey
- It is a USB device you plug in the USB port that authenticates access without a code
- 1 key can access multiple accounts

#### Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
- Generates a code every 30 seconds
- Enter the code during log in and is a bit old school
- Good for places where electrical devices are not allowed

#### Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud
- Specifically for users in AWS GovCloud in the US

## How Users Can Access AWS

### 3 Ways:
1. **AWS Management Console** - protected by password + MFA
2. **AWS CLI** - protected by keys
3. **AWS SDK** - Software Development Kit for code: protected by access keys

### Access Keys:
- Can generate keys from the console and each user manages their key
- Access keys should not be shared
- **Access Key ID** = username
- **Secret Access Key** = password

![AWS Access Methods](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52f6367c-8fe1-4031-9313-2bf9f692221e)

### Example of Access Key

## What is the AWS CLI?

The AWS CLI lets you access to the API within your AWS management console however in a CLI format. It lets you run commands and it allows you to write scripts for resource management. Used in click ops to automate jobs.

## What is the AWS SDK?

### AWS SDK – Key Points

**What it is**: AWS Software Development Kit – a set of pre-made code libraries for different programming languages.

**Purpose**: Lets you interact with AWS services from your code (no need to use the AWS Console).

**Languages supported**:
- Python, JavaScript, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++
- **Mobile SDKs**: Android, iOS
- **IoT SDKs**: Arduino, Embedded C, etc.

**How it works**:
- Embed AWS actions (e.g., upload to S3, create EC2) directly in your app's code
- Write just a few lines instead of doing tasks manually in the console

**Example**: The AWS CLI is built on top of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

## IAM Roles for Services

### What are IAM Roles?
- Allow AWS services to act on your behalf without needing long-term credentials
- Provide temporary access instead of hardcoding access keys/passwords
- Improve security and flexibility

### Why use them?
- Services (like EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation) often need to interact with other AWS services
- Roles let them do this securely by attaching the right permissions

### Common Use Cases

#### EC2 Instance Roles
- Attach a role when launching an instance
- **Example**: EC2 reads/writes to S3 or DynamoDB

#### Lambda Function Roles
- Attach a role to a Lambda function
- **Example**: Lambda writes logs to CloudWatch or accesses S3

#### CloudFormation Roles
- Allows CloudFormation to create/manage resources across multiple services
- Keeps credentials secure while automating resource creation

### Key Point
- Think of IAM roles as temporary keys for services
- No hardcoded credentials
- Easy to control what permissions each service has

---

## IAM Security Tools

### IAM Credentials Report (Account Level)
A report that lists all your account's users and status of their various credentials.

### IAM Access Advisor
Shows the service permissions granted to users and when services were last accessed. You can use this info to revise your policies.

---

## IAM Guidelines and Best Practices

- Do not use root unless it's for initial account setup - use IAM user instead with correct setup
- **One physical user = one AWS user**
- Do not share logins and make sure everyone has an account
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions
- Create strong password policy
- Enforce MFA to keep account secure
- Create and use roles for giving services permissions instead of hard coding
- Use access keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM credentials report and IAM access advisor
- **Never share IAM users or access keys**
